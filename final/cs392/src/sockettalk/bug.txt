I have two programs to submit. I have a regular client that contains client without
ncurses to prove it works, and then client with ncurses.

Ncurses literally looks like shit and I just was able to get socket_talk working today
(after working from roughly 10am-2am every day since classes ended) and also working
on socket_talk when it was first assigned. 
 
with socket_talk:
For the longest time (2 full days) I had an error where it would only print one
message from a user then when you tried to send a second message it would stop 
acknoledging a message had been sent. This was very challenging to solve and I thought
it was happening in my FD_ISSET. Finally I figured out it was actually an error in
where I placed my FD_ISSET - it was in a loop that it shouldn't have been in.

This was my major error that I remember but there were a multitude of others along
the way.

with ncurses:
Bug #1: When you type a letter, it breaks.
it does print in multiple colors but the input is unreadable(sorry).

I legit finished socket_talk like 2 hours ago so I was not able to do any further 
debugging.
